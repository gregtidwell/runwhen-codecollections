While most people immediately assume that an automated runbook is going to be focused on remediation, in practice many of our runbooks start as automated information collecting.  Simply codifying what needs to be collected helps immensely as we bring on new colleagues.

The runbook here is an example of these, a series of collection steps we use to troubleshoot the services in and around one of our REST api backends.  Note that this collects information from a variety of different sources and then packages it up in a report that we simply dump in to the team slack channel.

You can also see in this runbook the use of a robot framework idiom for custom keywords that are defined in the same file that uses them.  (See the **Keywords** section.)  We generally encourage a style where a custom keyword is used for Suite Setup to import user variables and secrets, and for Suite Teardown (guaranteed to run regardless of whether Tasks or Set Up ended with exceptions).  We generally shy away from the use of other custom keywords, instead recommending that these be composed in underlying python or java files in order to keep the spirit of the robot file readable as linear execution.
