Runbook tasks are intended to either run to completion (an implicit task pass) or throw an exception (task fail).  This runbook shows an example where we are using the Add To Report keyword to do automated information collection (see also analysis-example-1) but on top of that we use some very simple logic to do pass/fail.  This would be a natural evolution of a codebundle from analysis-example-1 as the team can begin to analyze information collected.

With roots in software QA, Robot Framework has a very user-friendly set of builtin keywords for looking at information collected, comparing it to expected values and passing or throwing an exception to fail the task.  These are documented here -- https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/BuiltIn.html#Should%20Be%20Empty -- specifically the family of keywords that begin with "Should" by convention.
