# Examples
This directory contains examples of workspaces and codecollections for the RunWhen platform.  The goal was not an exhaustive set of examples, but rather a small starter set for introductory/learning purposes.

In practice, each workspace and each codecollection would be in their own repository.  Those entire repos are copied here as directories for tutorial simplicity.

For further details on each, see the readme's in each directory.
